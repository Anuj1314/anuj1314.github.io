/* inline dont allow to set width, so inline-block using we are, to set the value of width */
/* if margin is together up and down, or side by side then it collapses and higher value will be considered */


A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

@media  only screen and (max-width:990px){
  .profile-info{
    width: 100%;
    overflow: inherit;
  }
  }
  so this attributes will be overwritten and other attributes will be takes as previous

span tag is like inline container
